## What we do

We built a compact, non-invasive wildlife tracking device using an ESP32 microcontroller, paired with a GY-521 accelerometer/gyroscope, pulse sensor, and GPS module. The system monitors an animalâ€™s movement, location, and heart rate, providing insights into its behavior, stress, and health in real time.

Data is collected by the ESP32 and transmitted via Wi-Fi or LoRa to a cloud platform for analysis. Researchers can use this information to identify patterns like rest, activity, or high-stress zones. The device is lightweight and power-efficientâ€”ideal for small to medium-sized animalsâ€”with deep-sleep modes to extend field deployment.

This setup can be expanded with solar charging, long-range communication, and AI-based behavior recognition, making it a powerful tool for modern wildlife conservation and ecological research.

The tracker is designed to confortablty sit inside of a 100mm x 70mm box that can be noninvasivelty attached to an animal.

## Goal
The goal of our project was to develop a non-invasive wildlife tracking device that can be safely attached to animals to monitor their location, movement, stress, and overall health in real time.

The data collected by the device is transmitted wirelesslyâ€”using protocols like Wi-Fi or LoRaâ€”to a cloud-based database hosted on Oracle Cloud. From there, the information can either be analyzed directly by researchers through an intuitive web dashboard or processed using AI models to identify behavioral patterns, health trends, and environmental responses over time.

Our aim is to equip conservationists, scientists, and wildlife organizations with a smart, scalable tool that supports better decision-making, enhances ecological research, and ultimately contributes to a more sustainable and biodiverse world.

## Accopmplishements - 
Weâ€™re excited to share that Rosie Wildlife Tracker won 3rd Place at the GMU Hackfax 2025 under the theme "A Better World"!

Check out the link to the Hackathon: https://hackfax-gmu-cs-club-2025.devpost.com/project-gallery 

Our team successfully demonstrated a working prototype that combines:
- Real-time GPS tracking
- Heartbeat monitoring for stress detection
- Motion sensing using accelerometer and gyroscope
- A 3D-printed, animal-mountable case
- A centralized system for wireless data transmission and visualization via Oracle Cloud

ðŸŒ± This recognition validates our mission to build smarter, low-cost tools for wildlife conservation. Weâ€™re grateful for the opportunity to present, learn, and collaborate â€” and we're excited to continue developing Rosie into a deployable field-ready system.

## Future Development 
During the hackathon, we began building a WordPress-based website hosted on Oracle Cloud to display real-time and historical data collected from the tracker. While we successfully deployed the backend infrastructure, full integration with live sensor data is still in progress.

Looking ahead, we aim to enhance the platform with an AI-powered analytics system. This would allow us to recognize behavioral patterns in animalsâ€”such as frequently visited locations, daily activity cycles, and changes in stress levels over time. By leveraging machine learning, our goal is to provide conservationists and researchers with deeper, automated insights into wildlife health and environmental interaction.

These future upgrades would make Rosie Wildlife Tracker a truly intelligent tool for wildlife monitoring and ecological research.
